**L1 Graph Tool**

Create graphs to visualize the L1 utilization. Built using Streamlit for the interface, along with Pandas and MatPlotLib for data manipulation and graph creation.

To run locally, install the requirements from requirements.txt with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, within the directory, run the command `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`. The web tool will default to opening on `http://localhost:8501` unless port 8501 is occupied.
